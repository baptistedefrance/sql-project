<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This SQL project given to us contains several steps to perform. We have at our disposal a database schema along with its corresponding database and we have a second schema without a database. The goal will therefore be to create this new schema with the tables and columns specified in an SQL script. Once our new schema has been created in a .db file, we must fill it with an SQL script which will be used to transfer the existing data from the first database to our second database. Finally, we will have to create a third SQL script that will allow us to perform SQL queries on our new database and retrieve certain requested information.

### Video Tutorial

You can use the Tutorial.mp4 to know how to use my scripts



### Run scripts

This documentation will explain how to use this tool. Here is a list of command to run each script.



### Prerequisites

You have to download python to run python script :
https://www.python.org/downloads/


#### BASH

To use our tool you can launch the sh menu with the command :

   ```sh
   sh menu.sh
   ```
#### Python

If you want to use my tool with many more possibilities and options you can use this python script. To be able to have a completely modifiable structure, I integrated my previously created SQL queries into a python script using the sqlite3 library. Thanks to this script I was able to make a complete tool for a user who wants to handle his databases :

on Mac OS :

   ```sh
   python3 migration.py
   ```
on Windows :
 ```sh
 python migration.py
   ```
